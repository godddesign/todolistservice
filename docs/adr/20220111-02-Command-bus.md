# Command bus
Currently, the requests from the JSON API adapter are sent directly to the request manager. Implement a NATS-based command bus as an intermediary channel.

## Status
Starting implementation.

## Context
Bearing in mind that this is a testbed application, it is considered appropriate to implement a generic reference mechanism to send and receive commands that later, eventually, can also be used for queries and events.

## Decision
Decouple driver adapters (JSON API, gRPC, and Web) from the direct command triggering process.

## Consequences
Commands are decoupled from adapters.
